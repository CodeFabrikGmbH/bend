This project is supposed to offer proxy-like functionality.

The app logs the requests which are made to this server. 
The requests can be observed at the dashboard page and can be sent to other target urls at a later date.

# Usage
The dashboard is available in the `/dashboard` path.

The configuration is available in the `/config` path.


# Unusable paths
Some endpoints are not available for tracking as they are in use for internal purposes. These are:

* /dashboard

* /config
  
* /static

* /delete
  
* /sendRequest
  
* /readme
  
* /favicon.ico
